#Fork Info
In this fork, I have fixed the inifinite loop for PHP 7.

## About
This is fork of PHamlP primarily for inclusiong as a Drupal pre-processor.
However, there is no Drupal-specific code and it will work for any PHP system.

This version of the compiler is NOT compatible with other forks of PHamlP, and
the name has been changed to reflect this.
